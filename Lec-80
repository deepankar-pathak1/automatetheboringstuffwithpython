# debugging

import pdb # import pdb module

# module : pyhton files contain usefull classes and function wrote by developer

# dubugging is process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a
# computer program that prevent correct operation
# of computer software or a system

# why debuuging

# 1) our program is not running and causing unexpected errors
# 2) our program is working fine but not working the same way we want..


# steps for debugging

# 1) set trace
# 2) execute code line by line

# we use "l" to know which line is ruuning
# we use "n" to go for next line
# "c" is used for continue running the code


pdb.set_trace() # to start debugging
name = input("name : ")
age = input("Age : ")
print(f"Hey {name} and age {age}")
age2 = age + 5
print(f"{name} You will be {age2} in next 5 year")
