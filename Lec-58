# generator comprehension

# as we have learned earlier
# list comprehension

# sq = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
# print(sq)

sq_gen = (i**2 for i in range(1,11))
print(sq_gen) # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x00000289432ED6D0>

# in generated comprehension we have used parenthesis in place of square bracket that we use in list 

for num in sq_gen:
    print(num,end=" ") # 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
