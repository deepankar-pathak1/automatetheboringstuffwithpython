# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is Created you can't update


# example = ('one','two','three')
# #no append, no insert , no pop, no remove
# # tuples are faste than list
#
# days = ('Monday')
# print(days)

# method
# count, index
# len function
# slicing
# once tuple is declared it cannot be changed

# looping with tuple
# mix = (1,2,3)
# for i in mix:
#     print(i)
# # for and while both can be apply
#
# # tuple with one element
# m = (1)
# print(type(m))
# n = (1,)
# print(type(n))
#
# <class 'int'>
# <class 'tuple'>

# tuple unpacking

# guitar = ("deepu","pathak")
# guitar1, guitar2 = (guitar)
# print(guitar1)
# print(guitar2)

# list inside tuples
#
# lst = ("name",["what","name"])
# print(lst)
# lst[1].pop() # as we have list we can perform this operations
# print(lst)

# we can do min(), max(), sum
