# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# OOP IS JUST  A STYLE/WAY TO WRITE CODE

# VERY HELPFUL IN CREATING REAL WORLD PROGRAMS

# CLASS, OBJECT(INSTANCE),METHOD

# BASICALLY IN PYTHON EVERYTHING IS OBJECT

# LET'S ASSUME WE HAVE CLASS

# LIST CLASS

# LIST OBJECT

# METHOD

# l = [1,2,3] # LIST OBJECT
# 
# l2 = [2,3,4] # LIST OBJECT
# 
# l.append(8) # method

# Basically in class we decide our incoming object..
