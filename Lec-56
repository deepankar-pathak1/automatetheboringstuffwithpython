# create your first generator with generator function

# 1) generator function
# we use yield keyword inplace of print to create generator.

# 10, 1 To 10

# def nums(n):
#     for i in range(1,n+1):
#         yield(i)  # << we use yield keyword >>
#
#
# # print(nums(10)) # <generator object nums at 0x000001A70195D6D0>
#
# # for number in nums(10):
# #     print(number)
#
# # genrator creates a one number at single time in memory
# # memory .....>1
# # memory .....>2
# # memory .....>3
# # memory .....>4
# # memory .....>5
#
# # and so on...
#
# # and here next is created when we want or we tell it to generate number.
#
# # and here for loop is demanding to generate next number ..
#
# number = nums(10)
#
# # for num in number:  (A)
#     print(num,end=" ")
#
# # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
#
#
# # for num in number:  (B)
#     print(num,end=" ")


# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


# in case A number is genrated and deleted and when we again
# created the another for loop again number is created and deleted.

# so we can say that generator created number one time and then delete it.
